console.log(
`The airship C456 has travel to Mars. Mars it's even weirder than we first though,
it's a 2 dimensional planet based on coordinates x and y, both of them go from 0 to 9. 

On our mission we left Rover to explore this grid. Rover will move through and tell us his positions, 
it's all Rover can do. Rover will move forward and backwards, it will also turn 90ยบ degrees facing always North, South, 
East and West. At some point in his life Rover  could move also left and right but Rover lost this functions, it's old. 
Probably this will be his last trip. Take care of him.

Control commands:

turnLeft(rover) = turn 90ยบ left
turnRight(rover) = turn 90ยบ right
moveForward(rover) = move 1 position on x or y depending the direction
moveBackward(rover) = move 1 position on x or y depending the direction
  
Rover also got an extra trick. It can make several moves calling the function: multipleMovements('').
You must put into the '' r = turn right, l = turn left, f = move forward, b = move backward. As an example:

multipleMovements('llffflfff')

Situation:

Rover decided to start on position 0, 0 (upside left corner). Facing north. 

To begin with you should turn until he face East or South. If not, Rover can't move. We recommend to print the map
to get an idea. Make use of: printMars()

Have luck.`)
